# Golang Playground

The repository contains code I have used to enable me to learn [Go](https://golang.org/).

# Setup

Add the following lines to your bash profile

```bash
export GOPATH=/Users/stevenwade/go/
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```

Now execute the following command:

```bash
$ go get github.com/swade1987/golang-playground
```
